# Eat Da Burger!

A full stack burger-logger web app featuring the use of Node, Express server, Handlebars for view generation and a homemade ORM. Node and MySQL are used to query and route data flow in the app. 

The app itself is fairly straightforward but the focus here was to practice data flow, routing, view generation, etc., in a full stack design.
